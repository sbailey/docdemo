This is a demo page of features we need for easy documentation. Basics \u00b6 mkdocs+Markdown supports basic features like italics and bold and external links . It also supports links to other pages in a nested hierarchy, and to specific subsections of the current document (e.g. code examples ) or sections in other documents . Scope of SVDA \u00b6 We definitely need bullet lists: SV1 : Deep observations spanning multiple nights of tiles designed with extra-broad target selection cuts for the purpose of generating truth tables and refining target selection choices. SV2 : a mini-survey \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for starting SV3 SV3 : near-final target selection observed with overlapping \u201crosettes\u201d of tiles achieving nearly complete coverage of those targets in the covered areas of sky And numbered lists too; interleaving with sub-bullets is a bonus we did this blat foo then that then some more I didn\u2019t figure out how to do 2a, 2b\u2026 style number-then-letter sub-bullets. A table about SVDA \u00b6 Here\u2019s what a table would look like Target class SV1 SV2 SV3 ELG many a few enormous LRG lots a few even more QSO 123 4 566 RBG N/A N/A N/A BGS a bunch ? ! MWS 1 2 3 Code examples \u00b6 Somewhere we\u2019ll have tutorial code, for which we\u2019ll want inline code like a = blat(foo) and also fenced code blocks: import numpy as np from desispec.io import read_spectra sp = read_spectra ( 'spectra-0-1234.fits' ) Note that little icon in the upper right of the code block: that copies the code block to the clipboard \u2026 a nice little feature. Search \u00b6 Speaking of nice little features, see the \u201cSearch\u201d bar in the upper right of the page. That searches across the entire site, and comes built-in without any special config. Admonitions \u00b6 Admonitions are inline colored notes, separated from the rest of the text. They are a bit fancy, but potentially useful: Note Don\u2019t get carried away with admonitions. There should be more normal text than admonitions. More text blah blat lorem ipsum etc. Danger Beware of the ZWARN mask You get the idea. Formulas \u00b6 We can write LaTeX formulas inline \\(y = ax + b\\) and also as separate blocks: $$ m = \\sum_i c_i \\xi_i $$ Another formula $$ \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta $$ Warning the mathjax config for rendering formulas is the most fragile piece I\u2019ve found so far, and I needed some trial and error to get something working. The default instructions resulted in formulas with unnecessary vertical scroll bars; this config requires block formulas to come immediately after a previous paragraph with no space, e.g. Another formula $$ \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta $$ but not Another formula $$ \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta $$ That\u2019s the biggest \u201cgotcha\u201d I\u2019ve found so far with mkdocs. I suspect that it can be fixed with a better config and isn\u2019t baked into the format rules, since other configs I tried didn\u2019t have that restriction but did have the extra vertical scroll bars. Pretty pictures \u00b6 Inline pictures are easy to include: Project layout \u00b6 mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The documentation homepage. ... # Other markdown pages, images, directories, etc. More info \u00b6 See the Getting Started section of the About page for information about installing mkdocs and deploying the documentation.
